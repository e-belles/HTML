Question 1
==============

PartA
---------

Demand for electricity is given by $p(Q)=A-Q$, where:
$$Q=Q_r+\sum_{n=1}^{i=3}K_i$$

Our residual demand function is:  
$$Q_r=\sum_{n=1}^{i=3}q_i$$

Therefore $p(Q)=A-\sum_{n=1}^{i=3}q_i-\sum_{n+1}^{i=3}K_i$.

--------

Our profit maximisation function with respect to $q_1$ can be written as:
$$\max \Pi_i=(A-q_1-2q_j-\sum_{n=1}^{i=3}K_i-c)q_i$$

First Order Condition: $A-2q_i-2q_j-\sum_{n=1}^{i=3}K_i-c=0$

Second Order condition: $-2$.

---------

Since firms are symmetrical, $q_i=q_j$.

$$\therefore q_i=\frac{A-\sum_{n=1}^{i=3}K_i-c}{4}$$
$$p(Q)=A-\sum_{n=1}^{i=3}q_i-\sum_{n=1}^{i=3}K_i$$

$$p(Q)=A-\frac{3(A-\sum_{n=1}^{i=3}K_i-c)}{4}-\sum_{n=1}^{i=3}K_i$$
$$p(Q)=\frac{A-\sum_{n=1}^{i=3}K_i+3c}{4}$$

Here is an example of a cournot equilibrium with two identical firms:

Part B
----------

$$Q_1=q_1+K_1$$

$$Q_1=\frac{A+3K_1-K_2-K_3-c}{4}$$

---------------

Therefore the marginal effect of $K_1$ on Firm 1's production quantity is:
$$\frac{dQ_1}{dK_1}=-\frac{3}{4}.$$

Given that firm's are symmetrical, the marginal effect of $K_1$ on Firm 2's production quantity is:
$$\frac{dQ_2}{dK_1}=-\frac{1}{4}.$$

Result
---------

We see that adopting a forward contract has a positive effect on that firm's total production levels, while it decreases the amount produced by other competing firms in the market.



Question 2
=============

------------



- In period 2 of the game, firms compete in a spot market identical to the market we solved for in question 1. 
- Due to arbritrage, the forward contract price F in period 1 must be identical to the spot price in period 2. 

----------

Therefore the spot price for period 1 is given by:
$$F=\frac{A-\sum_{n=1}^{i=3}K_i+3c}{4}$$

As follows, the firm's first period profit function is given by:

$$\Pi_i=(p(Q)-c)q_i+(F-c)K_i$$

-------------

In the first period, there are no existing forward contracts. Then $Q=\sum_{n=1}^{i=3}q_i$,

Our profit maximisation problem with respect to $K_i$ is given by:

$$max \Pi_i=(A-\sum_{n=1}^{i=3}q_i-c)q_i+(\frac{A-\sum_{n=1}^{i=3}K_i+3c}{4}-c)K_i$$

FOC: $\frac{A-2K_i-2K_j-c}{4}=0$

SOC:$-2$

-------

Since firms are symmetrical, $K_i=K_j$ and $K_i=\frac{A-c}{4}$.

$$\therefore F=\frac{A-\sum_{n=1}^{i=3}K_i+3c}{4}=\frac{A-\frac{3(A-C)}{4}+3c}{4}$$
$$F=\frac{A+15c}{8}$$

When we plug $K_i$ into $q_i$,

$$q_i=\frac{A-C}{8}$$
$$Q_i=\frac{3(A-c)}{4}$$


Question 3
=============

--------------

- In both papers, the authors try to show whether firms have strategic incentives for forward contracts in energy markets. 
- They seek to identify whether firms sell future contracts for hedging reasons or for strategic reasons. 

-------

- Brandt et al. (2008), on the other hand, focus only on strategic incentives in quantity competition and supply function competition. 
- Mainly, they try to figure out how forward contracts help to reduce prices in spot markets by increasing quantity produced.

------------------------------

- Results of the paper show that the introduction of forward markets lead to a decline in prices and a rise in quantity produced. 
- This situation mitigates the market power of firms and leads to more competition in the market. 

--------------

- As indicated in the van Eiken and Morraga-Gonzales paper, every firm has an incentive to enter the forward market, as aggregate production is higher than in the absence of a forward contract.
